# Mini-Cafe-Management
This Python mini-project simulates a simple ‘Cafe Management System’. It uses a dictionary to store menu items with their prices, allows users to enter orders, checks item availability using conditional statements, adds selected dishes to the bill, and finally calculates and displays the total amount to be paid.
